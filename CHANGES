  * Make paused part of the public interface.
  * Make the buffer of a destroyed stream null to save on memory.

    itself (thanks @jeffbski).

= 1.0.2 / 2012-10-07

  * Use setInterval instead of process.nextTick to prevent pegging the CPU

  * Use Infinity instead of -1 to indicate that a stream has no maximum size
    (thanks @mscdex).
  * Use mocha for testing.
